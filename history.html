  <h1>Company History</h1>
  <section>
  Defkon-3, Inc. was founded in 2014, about 6 years prior to Z-Day, when the first of the walkers were first discovered.  This was of course, long before what would later become the Horde, had a chance to grow and overrun the entire globe.  We were already supplying the necessities for survivial in the post-apocalyptic world to those who wanted to be prepared for the worst.  We still stand strong in our committment to supply what is left of the non-walker/zombie population with the finest quality zombie survival gear available.  We even discovered a way to make lemonade out of lemons by putting zombies to work!  When we ran low on humans to staff our company, we turned our Research and Development team loose to focus on harnessing the zombies to do our bidding.  Now, we have zombies all the way from managerial level to shipping and delivery staff!  Our brand of weapons ranging from fully automatic machine guns, chainsaws, flamethrowers and spiked baseball bats are of the highest quality and will put down a range of walkers from a few stragglers to a huge, wandering horde coming for you and your loved ones' brains.  Our instant meals, water purifiers, solar-powered generators and other survival tools have proven themselves reliable time and again in the post-apocolyptic wastes of Earth.  Defkon-3 is the frontrunner and standard-bearer for all other survival suppliers that have managed to stay in business thus far.
